Pandas Parameter to play with data. When to use:
# 1. sep Parameter:
# Use this when the data is separated by a custom delimiter (other than commas).
# Example: sep="\t" for tab-separated values, or sep="|" for pipe-separated values.

# 2. index_col Parameter:
# Use this when you want one or more columns to be used as the index of the DataFrame.
# Example: index_col=0 to set the first column as the index.

# 3. header Parameter:
# Use this to specify which row to use as column names (header).
# Default is header=0 (first row). For example, header=1 if the header is in the second row.

# 4. usecols Parameter:
# Use this to read specific columns from the dataset.
# Example: usecols=["col1", "col2"] to only read the specified columns.

# 5. squeeze Parameter:
# Use this when you want to reduce the output from a DataFrame to a Series, 
# if only a single column is selected. Example: squeeze=True.

# 6. skiprows / nrows Parameters:
# - skiprows: Skip specific rows at the beginning. Example: skiprows=5 to skip the first 5 rows.
# - nrows: Limit the number of rows to load. Example: nrows=100 to load only the first 100 rows.

# 7. encoding Parameter:
# Use this when your dataset has a specific encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1).
# It's especially useful for datasets with special characters or non-English text.

# 8. skip_bad_lines (or error_bad_lines in older versions):
# Use this when your data contains corrupt lines that you want to ignore while loading.
# Example: error_bad_lines=False to skip bad lines.

# 9. dtype Parameter:
# Use this to specify the data types for certain columns, especially if pandas' default type inference is incorrect.
# Example: dtype={"age": int, "salary": float}.

# 10. Handling Dates:
# Use parse_dates to automatically convert date columns to datetime objects.
# You can also define a custom date parser with date_parser if needed.
# Example: parse_dates=["date_column"] to parse a date column.

# 11. converters Parameter:
# Use this to apply custom functions to columns while reading the file.
# Example: converters={"column_name": custom_function} to transform data on the fly.

# 12. na_values Parameter:
# Use this to specify additional strings to be treated as missing (NaN) values.
# Example: na_values=["N/A", "NULL"] to treat these strings as NaN.

# 13. Loading Huge Datasets in Chunks:
# Use chunksize to load large datasets in smaller, manageable parts.
# Example: chunksize=1000 to load data in chunks of 1000 rows at a time.
# This helps reduce memory usage and handle large files efficiently.

# ---------------------------- EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ----------------------------
"""
Why we need Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)?
-> We need EDA to understand and visualise the important characteristics of the data.
-> It also detect anamolies, testing assumptions and generate hypothesis.

EDA is of three type: Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis and Multi-variate Analysis.
- Univariate Analysis: When we do independent analysis on 1 columns
- Bivariate Analysis: When we do independent analysis on 2 columns
- Multi-variate Analysis: When we do independent analysis on more than 2 columns

There are two types of data: Categorical and Numerical
- Numerical: height, weight, age, ...etc
- Categorical: country, gender, nationality, ...etc

Actually in EDA we plot the data distributions to check if the data or the column 
have the normal distribution or not. If they dont have the normal distribution 
then we perform the Feature Engineering on it to transform that data. 

We plot the Probability Density Function (PDF).
- if PDF is normal distributed then no need to change or transform it
- else we need to apply the feature engineering to transform the data.

NOTE: We actually do mostly Bivariate and MultiVariate Analysis.

For Univariate Analysis we do the plots like:
1. For Categorical Data: Countplot and Piechart
2. For Numerical Data: Histogram, DistPlot, BoxPlot.

For Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis we do the plots like:
We plot the data in the form of the (Numerical - Numerical), (Numerical - Categorical), (Categorical - Categorical)
We can say as => (N - N), (N - C), (C - C)

1. ScatterPlot: (Numerical - Numerical)
2. BarPlot:     (Numerical - Categorical)
3. BoxPlot:     (Numerical - Categorical)
4. DistPlot:    (Numerical - Categorical)
5. HeatMap:     (Categorical - Categorical)
6. ClusterMap:  (Categorical - Categorical)
7. PairPlot:    (Numerical - Numerical)
8. LinePlot:    (Numerical - Numerical)

(Numerical - Numerical): ScatterPlot, LinePlot, PairPlot
(Numerical - Categorical): BarPlot, BoxPlot, DistPlot
(Categorical - Categorical): HeatMap, ClusterMap

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If you find any probability distribution function plotting as the normal distribution, then it doesn't need to be transformed by the feature engineering.
If you find any probability distribution function plotting as the skewness distribution, then it need to be transformation with the help of the feature engineering.

You will get some of the Normal distributed data to be contained as the: missing values. This need to be fixed in feature engineering no doubt in this.

Normal Distribution: A good curve in the middle of the plot
Skewness Distribution: A curve that is shifted towards more to the left or to the right.

# ---------------------------- RIDGE REGRESSION [2 Dimensional] ----------------------------
"""
Ridge Regression in 2 dimensional is similar to the Simple Linear Regression. However there is term added in the Loss Function of the Ridge Regression which is the penality term.
Penalty term = λ ||w||^2. Here, w is the coefficients. Previously we have denoted w as coefficients. It actually work like weights.
The λ is the hyperparameter which is the regularization parameter. It is the hyperparameter which is used to control the strength of the penalty term. If the λ is high, then the penalty term is high and the model is regularized heavily. If the λ is low, then the penalty term is low and the model is regularized lightly.

Formula:
penalty_term =  λ (We call it as alpha)
numerator = summation_1toN ((y_i - y_mean) * (x_i - x_mean))
denominator = summation_1toN ((x_i - x_mean) ^ 2)
m (slope) = [(numerator) / (denomenator + penalty_term)]
b (intercept) = y_mean - m * (x_mean)

- Inserting the 1's to the first row of the X_train

- Identity matrix = np.identity(X_train.shape[1])
- penalty_term = self.alpha * identity_matrix
- Calculate W from the above numpy explanation
- Set the values of the coefficient and intercept:

- Prediction => Y = mX + C => (coefficient, X_train) + intercept
