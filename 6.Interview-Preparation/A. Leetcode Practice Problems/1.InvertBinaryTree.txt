2. https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array [using numpy (as in the comments) takes more time]
3. Difference between array capacity and length of array: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/521/introduction/3295/
    - Capacity: The total amount of space that has been initially allocated for the array. 
    This is the maximum number of elements that the array can hold without needing to allocate more memory.
    - Length: The actual number of elements that are currently stored in the array.
