LLMs(Large Language Model):

1. Multiple models belong to llama 2 series (created by Meta) [7B, 13B, 34B, 70B] models.

2. Many people like this model specifically because probably today it is the most powerful 
   open weights model. So, basically, weights, architecture and paper allreleased by Meta. In case of 
   ChatGPT, model architecture is not released. It is owned by OpenAI. 

3. parameters are basically the weights or parameters of the neural network.  For example,
   in llama-2-70B, total parameters are 70 billions and each parameter is stored in 2 Bytes 
   (due to float16 number as he data type). And so, parameter file is of 140GB.

4. Model inference is just like running model on your system and moel training is a computationally
   involved process.
